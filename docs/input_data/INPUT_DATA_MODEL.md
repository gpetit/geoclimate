# Input data model



This page presents the input data model used to describe the geographic data that feed the GeoClimate chain. 

## Tables *vs* Modules

The user has the choice to enter the Geoclimate chain with two kinds of formalisms:

- the resulting layers from the Module 1. In this case, the user has then to execute the Module 2 
- the resulting layers from the Module 2. In this case, the user is ready to execute the Module 3

<img src="../images/modules.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

Below are presented both approaches.

## Presentation

The data are organized by topics. For each of them, we provide the following informations:

### The input table structure ![](../images/icons/table.png)

- the expected **table name** :  `input_xxxx` as an output of the "Module 1" or `XXXXX` as an output of "Module 2" ,
- the **name**, the **type** and the **constraints** of the **columns**.



**Remarks**

- ![](../images/icons/earth.png) The tables have to use a same [EPSG](https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/) code, pointing to a **metric** coordinate system.
- ![](../images/icons/pk.png) The Primary Keys called `id_building`, `id_road`, `id_rail`, `id_veget`, `id_hydro`, `id_impervious` listed in the following tables are added during the Module 2 process (so they are not expected at the output of Module 1) .
- ![](../images/icons/warning.png) Some columns (e.g `height_wall`, `height_roof`, `width`, *etc*) may accept null values in Module 1 (M1). If there are null values at the input of Module 2 (M2) then this module will fill them in, based on the rules described here.

### The expected values ![](../images/icons/table_values.png)

When necessary, a list of values that a column must take, with :

- the expected **Term**,
- a **Definition**,
- a **Source**: most of the values are based on concepts from existing thesauri. In this case, we indicate their source.

## Topics

- [Buildings](#Buildings):  `input_BUILDING`, BUILDING use and type

**Method**: `SUM(Bu_FLOOR_AREA) / RSU_Area`

 

### `BUILDING_VOLUME_DENSITY`

**Description**: Density of building volumes within the RSU.

**Method**: `SUM(Bu_VOLUME) / NB_Building`



### `AVG_VOLUME_AREA_WEIGHTED`

**Method**: `SUM(Bu_Volume * Bu_Area) / SUM(Bu_Area)`



### `GEOM_AVG_HEIGHT_ROOF`

**Description**: RSU geometric mean of the building roof heights.

**Method**: `EXP(SUM(LOG(Bu_ROOF_HEIGHT)) / NB_Building)`



[back to top](#the-rsu_indicators-table)




### `AVG_HEIGHT_ROOF_AREA_WEIGHTED`

**Description**: Mean building’s roof height within the RSU (the building heights being weighted by the building areas)

**Method**: `SUM(Bu_Wall_Height * Bu_Area) / SUM(Bu_Area)`



### `STD_HEIGHT_ROOF_AREA_WEIGHTED`

**Description**: Variability of the building’s roof height within the RSU (the building heights being weighted by the building areas)

**Method**: By default, the indicator of variability is the Standard Deviation (STD) defined as :

→ `SUM(Bu_Area*(Bu_Wall_Height - AVG_HEIGHT_ROOF_AREA_WEIGHTED)^2)) / SUM (Bu_Area)`


### `FREE_EXTERNAL_FACADE_DENSITY`

**Description**: Sum of all building free facades (roofs are excluded) included in a RSU, divided by the RSU area.

**Method**: `SUM((1 - Bu_Contiguity) * Bu_TotalFacadeLength * HEIGHT_WALL) / RSU_Area`

 

### `NON_VERT_ROOF_AREA_Hx_y`

**Description**: The non-vertical (horizontal and tilted) roofs area is calculated within each vertical layer of a RSU (the bottom of the layer being at `x` meters from the ground while the top is at `y` meters).

**Method**: The calculation is based on the assumption that all buildings having a roof height higher than the wall height have a gable roof (the other being horizontal). Since the direction of the gable is not taken into account for the moment, we consider that buildings are square in order to limit the potential calculation error (otherwise a choice should have been made to locate the line corresponding to the top of the roof).



### `NON_VERT_ROOF_DENSITY`

**Description**: RSU surface density of non-vertical roofs (horizontal and tilted roofs).

**Method**: `SUM(Non_vert_roof_area_Hx_y) / RSU_Area`



[back to top](#the-rsu_indicators-table)



### `VERT_ROOF_AREA_Hxx_xx`

**Description**: Vertical roofs area is calculated within each vertical layer of a RSU (the bottom of the layer being at `x` meters from the ground while the top is at `y` meters).

**Method**: The calculation is based on the assumption that all buildings having a roof height higher than the wall height have a gable roof (the other being horizontal). Since the direction of the gable is not taken into account for the moment, we consider that buildings are square in order to limit the potential calculation error (otherwise a choice should have been made to locate the line corresponding to the top of the roof).

[back to top](#the-rsu_indicators-table)



### `MAIN_BUILDING_DIRECTION`

**Description**: Main direction of the buildings contained in a RSU.

**Method**: The building direction distribution is calculated according to the length of the building SMBR sides (width and length). The [0, 180]° angle range is splitted into `nb_directions` angle ranges . Then the length of each SMBR building side is attributed to one of these ranges according to the side direction. Within each angle range, the total length of SMBR sides are summed and then the mode of the distribution is taken as the main building direction.



### `INEQUALITY_BUILDING_DIRECTION` 

**Description**: Indicates how unequal is the RSU building direction distribution (having `nb_direction` directions of analysis).

**Range of values**: [1/nb_direction, 1] -> the lower the value the most unequal is the distribution

**Method**: `SUM(Min(1/Nb_direction, Length_dir_i / length_all_dir))`



### `UNIQUENESS_BUILDING_DIRECTION` 

**Description**: Indicates how unique is the RSU main building direction.

**Range of values**: [1, +inf] - the higher the value, the more unique is the main building direction

**Method**: `Length_First_Dir / Length_Second_Dir `



### `ASPECT_RATIO`

**Description**: aspect ratio such as defined by Stewart et Oke (2012): mean height-to-width ratio of street canyons (LCZs 1-7), building spacing (LCZs 8-10), and tree spacing (LCZs A - G).

**Method**: A simple approach based on the street canyons assumption is used for the calculation. The sum of facade area within a given RSU area is divided by the area of free surfaces of the given RSU (not covered by buildings).

→ `RSU_free_external_facade_density / (1 - RSU_building_density)`



### `GROUND_SKY_VIEW_FACTOR`

**Description**: RSU ground Sky View Factor such as defined by Stewart et Oke (2012): ratio of the amount of sky hemisphere visible from ground level to that of an unobstructed hemisphere.

**Method**: The calculation is based on the [ST_SVF](http://www.h2gis.org/docs/dev/ST_SVF/) function of H2GIS using the following parameters: ray length = 100, number of directions = 60. Using a uniform grid mesh of 10 m resolution, the SVF obtained has a standard deviation of the estimate of 0.03 when compared with the most accurate method (according to [Bernard et al. (2018)](https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli6030060)).

Using a grid of regular points, the density of points used for the calculation actually depends on building density (higher the building density, lower the density of points). To avoid this phenomenon and have the same density of points per free ground surface, we use an H2GIS function to distribute randomly points within free surfaces (ST_GeneratePoints). This density of points is set by default to 0.008, based on the median of [Bernard et al. (2018)](https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli6030060) dataset.

### `PROJECTED_FACADE_AREA_DISTRIBUTION_Hx_y_Dw_z`

**Description**: Distribution of projected facade area within a RSU per vertical layer (the height being from `x` to `y`) and per direction of analysis (ie. wind or sun direction - the angle range being from `w` to `z` within the range [0, 180[°). 

**Method**: Each line representing the facades of a building are projected in order to be perpendicular to the median of each angle range of analysis. Only free facades are considered. The projected surfaces are then summed within each layer and direction of analysis. The analysis is only performed within the [0, 180[° range since the projected facade of a building is identical for opposite directions. Thus because we consider all facades of a building in the calculation (facades upwind but also downwind), the final result is divided by 2.

**Warning**: To simplify the calculation, z0 is considered as equal for a given orientation independently of the direction. This assumption is right when the RSU do not split buildings but could slightly overestimate the results otherwise (the projected facade area is actually overestimated in one direction but OK in the opposite direction).

 

### `EFFECTIVE_TERRAIN_ROUGHNESS_LENGTH`

**Description**: Effective terrain roughness length (z0).

**Method**:  The method for z0 calculation is based on the Hanna and Britter (2010) procedure (see equation (17) and examples of calculation p. 156 in the corresponding reference). The `rsu_projected_facade_area_distribution_Hx_y_Dw_z` is used to calculate the mean projected facade density (considering all directions) and `z0` is then obtained multiplying the resulting value by the `rsu_geometric_mean_height`.

**Warning**: the calculation of z0 is only performed for angles included in the range [0, 180[°. To simplify the calculation, z0 is considered as equal for a given orientation independently of the direction. This assumption is right when the RSU do not split buildings but could slightly overestimate the results otherwise (z0 is actually overestimated in one direction but OK in the opposite direction).

### `EFFECTIVE_TERRAIN_ROUGHNESS_CLASS`

**Description**: Effective terrain class from the effective terrain roughness length (z0). The classes are defined according to the Davenport lookup Table (cf Table 5 in Stewart and Oke, 2012)

**Method**: The Davenport definition defines a class for a unique z0 value (instead of a range). Then there is no definition of the z0 range corresponding to a certain class. We have arbitrarily defined the boundary between two classes as the arithmetic average between the z0 values of each class.

**Warning**: The choice for the interval boundaries has been made arbitrarily. A definition of the interval based on a log profile of class = f(z0) could lead to different results (especially for classes 3, 4 and 5).

### `ROAD_DIRECTION_DISTRIBUTION_H0_Dw_z`

**Description**: Distribution of road length within a RSU per direction of analysis (ie. wind or sun direction - the angle range being from `w` to `z` within the range [0, 180[°). Note that by default, only roads located at ground level are considered for the calculation (z_index = 0).

**Method**: The direction of each segment of road is calculated. The percentage of linear of road in each range of direction is then calculated (a range is defined - default 30°) for directions included in [0, 180[°.



### `LINEAR_ROAD_DENSITY_H0`

**Description**: Road linear density, having a ZINDEX = 0, within the RSU.

**Method**: Linear of road at zindex = 0 within a RSU divided by the RSU area



[back to top](#the-rsu_indicators-table)



### `GROUND_ROAD_FRACTION`

**Description**: Fraction of road areas, having a `ZINDEX` = 0, within the RSU.

**Method**: The road surfaces are determined thanks to the road `WIDTH` information. Then the sum of all road areas contained in a RSU (and having a `ZINDEX` = 0) is divided by the RSU area.



### `OVERGROUND_ROAD_FRACTION`

**Description**: Fraction of road areas, having a `ZINDEX` > 0, within the RSU. 

**Method**: The road surfaces are determined thanks to the road `WIDTH` information. Then the sum of all road areas contained in a RSU (and having a `ZINDEX` > 0) is divided by the RSU area.

**Description**: Fraction of water areas within the RSU.

**Method**: `SUM(water areas) / RSU area `



### `LOW_VEGETATION_FRACTION`

**Description**: Fraction of "low" vegetation areas within the RSU
